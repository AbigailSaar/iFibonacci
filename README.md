fibonacci series generator


Write two functions to generate fibonacci series. Function specs are as follows:

1. Function name = fib1()
    number of arguments = 1
        argument_1 = integer value N where N = number up to which fibonacci series is generated
    return value = list of fibonacci numbers up to N

2. Function name = fib2()
    number of arguments = 1
        argument_1 = integer value N where N = length of fibonacci series to generate
    return value = list of first N fibonacci numbers
